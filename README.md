Ride sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft are creating the future for how people commute. Lyft currently provides one million rides per day, while Uber has recently reached 5 billion rides. Consequently, traditional taxi services are struggling to keep up. Both Uber and Lyft have their own application which users can request rides through, while the majority of traditional cab services do not. The proposal of RIDR is to utilize the YELP!, Lyft, and Uber API in order to combine all of these services into one app. This will allow us to provide users with the chance to see all their available ride options without having to download multiple apps or knowing what local taxi companies are available. With enough users, this model could encourage competitive pricing and lower surge rates.
